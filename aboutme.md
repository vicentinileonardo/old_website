<i>“Learning never exhausts the Mind.” — Leonardo da Vinci</i>

Hi, I'm Leonardo, a Master's degree student in **Computer Science** at the University of Trento, Italy.
In July I will begin my thesis work on **Cloud FinOps** as the final step toward completion of my studies.
I am curious about cloud-native solutions and system design in general. Interested in experimenting with and learning about cutting-edge technologies, tools, and paradigms.

# Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities that stimulate my mind. I am passionate about learning new things and expanding my horizons. I am always looking for new hobbies to try and new skills to learn. Here are a few of my current hobbies:

## Space Exploration

I have always been fascinated by space and everything about it. I keep up with the latest space exploration missions and discoveries. I follow SpaceX, NASA and the European Space Agency to stay informed of new satellites, rovers, and astronaut flights. I love seeing amazing photographs from space and learning about the mysteries of our solar system and the universe. I am especially interested in the search for extraterrestrial life and the possibility of colonizing other planets. 
I like to read papers and articles about future theories and technologies like the Dyson sphere, generation ships and planet terraforming. I am also interested in the ethical implications and the social impact of these technologies.
I am excited to see what the future holds for space exploration and **humanity's place in the universe**.

## Movies

I am an avid movie lover, especially those with an intriguing plot that makes me think. I especially enjoy the darkly comedic films of Quentin Tarantino with complex characters and intertwining storylines. Some of my favorites are **Pulp Fiction** (there is an easter egg in this website 😉 ), The Hateful Eight, Kill Bill and Django Unchained. I enjoy analyzing Tarantino's unconventional movie structure, intense dialogues and choice of music.

I had the idea of creating a **software project** that analyzes Tarantino's movies and extracts interesting information from them. For example, I would like to create a graph of the characters and their relationships in each movie, since the characters are often connected in surprising ways.
I would also like to analyze the dialogues and create some visualizations of the most used words and phrases. I think this would be a fun project to work on and a great way to learn more about data analysis and visualization, which is a field I am interested in.
This project is on my list of things to do in the future.

Beyond Tarantino, I appreciate movies like Inception, The Matrix, and Interstellar that explore the nature of reality and the human mind. I also enjoy watching **documentaries** about space, science, and history. I find it fascinating to learn about the world around us and the people who have shaped it.

## Italian Mysteries

I delve into the most intriguing unsolved mysteries in Italian history like the Monster of Florence, the P2 Masonic Lodge and the Vatican Bank Scandal.
I am fascinated by these mysteries because they are so complex and involve so many different people and organizations like a big distributed system to be analyzed.

I like to read articles and blog posts and watch documentaries about these mysteries to learn more about them like the series "Blu notte - Misteri italiani" by Carlo Lucarelli.
I enjoy the books of Gianluigi Nuzzi which uncover sinister conspiracies within the Vatican through secret document leaks...

The general rule is: the more the mystery is complex, the more I like it and the more I want to dig into it.

The twists and turns of the investigations remind me of the importance of critical thinking, open-mindedness and persistence in problem-solving - skills relevant both to studying and analyzing Italian mysteries and tackling the technical challenges of working in the software industry.
The comparison might seem a bit far-fetched, but I think it's a good way to train my mind to think outside the box and to be open to **new ideas and perspectives**.

Those are just a few of my passions outside of university and work. I find that following my hobbies keeps me learning, curious and engaged with the world.
